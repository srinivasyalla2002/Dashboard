## Admin Dashboard for Social Media Application

This is an admin dashboard for a social media application that allows administrators to manage users and posts. The dashboard is built using React.js and styled with CSS.

## Features
- Login Page: Simple login form to authenticate the admin.
- Home Page: Displays KPIs such as Total Users, Total Posts, Users Active in the Last 24 Hours, and Posts Published in the Last 24 Hours.
- Users Listing Page: Shows a list of users with their details and controls to ban or edit users.
- Posts Listing Page: Shows a list of posts with their details and controls to delete or hide posts.
- Side Bar: Provides easy navigation between different pages of the dashboard.


## Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or above)
npm or yarn

## Project Structure
- src/: Main source directory
- components/: Contains reusable UI components like Header, Sidebar, KPICard
- pages/: Contains page components like Home, Users, Posts, Login, NotFound
- styles/: Contains CSS files for styling components and pages
- App.js: Main application component
- index.js: Entry point of the application

## Dummy Data
The application uses dummy data for users and posts. You can find this data within the Home, Users, and Posts components.

## Authentication
The login page works with any set of credentials for demonstration purposes. The login state is managed using React state.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
